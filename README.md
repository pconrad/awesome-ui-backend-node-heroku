Project Awesome UI and Backend based on node.js on Heroku

# Getting Started

To get started with this code, you need to set up a few things first.  This list may not be complete; we'll add to it, as we discover things that are missing.

At a minimum, you'll need to set up your development environment with:
* The Heroku toolbelt for working with Node.js (follow the tutorial at heroku.com)
 * This includes, at least, git, node, and npm

After forking the repo, you need to run `npm install` from the root directory.  This will install various node.js modules as specified in package.json.  This includes, among other things:

* mocha, which is a test framework for node
* passport, which is used for authenticating against Facebook, Google, etc. for logins
* sequelize, which provides a database abstraction layer
